# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe? The most difficult part of tic-tac-toe was focusing on the actions and hoe to get them to do what you wanted, meaning fitting it into the program rather than just adding random actions.  


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game. I would add a computer player to the game by expanding the functions and adding more to actions that way it's more hands on and gives the program a chance to return / make a move.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it. In order to get the computer player to make the best moves, I'd try to make a function where it'd think of the possible positions that could lead it to win etc.
